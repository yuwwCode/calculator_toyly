# calculator_toyly
a toy project in learning Rust-lang

一个自己写的终端运行的计算器，只支持四则运算，求对数，求次幂
纯玩具，由于练手的产物，功能都是想一出是一出，比如对 {括号 || log求对数 || 自然对数:e} 的支持都是后加的，所以结构混乱

A self-written terminal-run calculator that only supports four arithmetic operations, including logarithms and powers.
It is a pure toy. Because it is a product of hands-on practice, the functions are added on a whim. For example, the support for {parentheses || logarithm || natural logarithm:e} was added later, so the structure is confusing.
